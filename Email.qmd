Hi Maria,

I am following up on our initial team meeting regarding how to best approach the hypothesis that customer churn in the SME segment is primarily driven by price sensitivity. Below is my proposed methodology:

#### Hypothesis

Our primary hypothesis is that SME customers are leaving PowerCo because of price sensitivity. This means that we are looking to predict the likelihood of churn based on price-related factors.

-   The outcome variable will be `churn`
-   The predictor variable will be `price` or `price changes`

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

#### Data Required

To test this hypothesis, we would need historical data from PowerCo, specifically related to the SME customer segment. An ideal data frame would look like the following:

-   

## Additional Information

The below information will not be added to the email. However, it provides context behind my approach.

**Null Hypothesis** $H_0$

There [is no]{.underline} relationship between price-related factor (like 'price' or 'price changes') and the likelihood of SME customers churning from PowerCo.

**Alternative Hypothesis** $H_A$

This [is]{.underline} a relationship between price-related factor (like 'price' or 'price changes') and the likelihood of SME customers churning from PowerCo.

$$
\text{Probability(Churn)} = \frac{1}{1 + \text{exp}(-(\text{Intercept} + \text{Coefficient1} \times \text{Monthly\_Bill} + \text{Coefficient2} \times \text{Price\_Change} + \ldots))}
$$
