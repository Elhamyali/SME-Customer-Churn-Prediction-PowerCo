Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Additional Information

The below information will not be added to the email. However, it provides context behind my approach.

**Null Hypothesis** $H_0$

**Alternative Hypothesis** $H_A$

This [is]{.underline} a relationship between price-related factor (like 'price' or 'price changes') and the likelihood of SME customers churning from PowerCo.
